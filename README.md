This repository provides data and scripts to analyze *Monitpora capitata* gene expression dynamics across five life stages from fertilization to 9-day planula under ambient (7.84 pH), low (7.64 pH), and extreme-low pH (7.34 pH) conditions. This analysis provides data characterizing the transcriptomic response of each developmental stage to ocean acidification during and after the Maternal-to-Zygotic transition (MZT).
